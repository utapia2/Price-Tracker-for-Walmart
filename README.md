# Price-Tracker-for-Walmart
It is a website price tracker! So far it tracks any walmart page, will add fucntionality for Best Buy and Target
It asks for a website item page, it lists the current price and then asks you what price you wish it would be.
It emails you once the item is at or below the set price
Checks evey 6 hours, will add prompt for user to decide how frequent they want to check

No longer works, was great when it did.
